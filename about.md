Rapid development of DNA sequencing technologies has made it possible for biomedical disciplines to rival the physical sciences in data production capability. Today’s sequencing instruments rival those fields in terms of data throughput. Yet biology is different from these disciplines in one fundamental aspect—the lack of computational and data analysis training in standard biomedical curricula.

The main challenge with the explosion of biomedical datasets is not the data and the respective required storage space, nor the computational resources, but rather the general lack of trained and skilled researchers to manipulate and analyze these data. The need for such training cannot be overstated; while the majority (>95%) of researchers work or plan to work with large datasets, most (>65%) possess only minimal bioinformatics skills and are not comfortable with statistical analyses (Larcombe et al, 2017; Williams and Teal, 2017). This overwhelming need drives the demand, which, at present, greatly exceeds supply (Attwood et al, 2017). In a recent survey from EMBL-ABR, over 60% of biologists expressed the need for more training while only 5% called for additional computing power.

Different communities such as GOBLET, ELIXIR, EMBL, The Carpentries and Galaxy, are tackling this problem by creating and providing high quality, decentralized, accessible, and practical training in computational data analysis to biomedical researchers worldwide.
The impact of these efforts is already evident, with many researchers now being able to analyze their own data. However, each of these communities are developing material covering one or two aspects of the full data analysis process in life science i.e. data management and metadata, bioinformatics and data analysis, or basic computing and scripting skills. Moreover the provided workshops are not always accessible nor inclusive.

Given their cumulative experience and expertise in training for Life Sciences, the next step for these communities is to work together towards a full curriculum on the computational analysis of HTS data, starting from raw data and leading up to the production of publication ready visualizations of the analysis results. More importantly, these training activities should be scalable and accessible to anyone around the globe, particularly for people unable to attend face-to-face workshops due to social, technical or cultural limitations, leveraging new technologies to overcome this obstacle.
