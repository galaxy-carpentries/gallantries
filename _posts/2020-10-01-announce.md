The [Gallantries]({% link about.md %}) has received a grant from Erasmus+ for developing 4 modular bioinformatics curricula that will let educators across Europe and beyond easily integrate modular lessons into their teaching programmes.

We will be developing 4 new modules:

- Introduction to data analysis and -management, statistics, and coding
- Large-scale data analysis, and introduction to visualisation and data modelling
- Data stewardship, federation, standardisation, integration, and collaboration.
- Data analysis for evidence and hypothesis generation and knowledge discovery

as well as a Train-the-Trainer programme. The project has started as of September and will run until August 2023.
