The Gallantries has finished our first event: ["the GTN Smörgåsbord: A Global Galaxy Course"](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/). We discussed our plans a bit in our previous post about the [Admin Training]({% link "2021-02-01-gat.md" }) which we were using as a testing ground for our methodology. We scaled that up in Smörgåsbord and it was absolutely incedible!

# About the Event

We had an unbelievable 1189 registrations from 76 different countries around the world. 583 of these joined Slack which we used to communicate during the event, surpassing our expectations.

We had been in the processing of planning a small, 20 person workshop in ErasmusMC when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. The workshop kept getting pushed back further and further and when we finally got around to planning it, we knew it would be online. A few of our collaborators got in touch saying they were interested in co-hosting this event and their communities were desperate for proteomics and mass spectometry training. So we said:

> Sure! We'll open this up to everyone. *What could go wrong*

With instructors and organisers from the CINECA and the Gallantries we developed a workable plan for an online, world-wide event. For this event we decided to go **fully asynchronous**. We would place *everything online* and students could follow along at their own pace, taking breaks whenever they liked. We identified this as a maximally productive solution: we can reach the widest audience with the very limited number of qualified instructors. We tested this at small scale and by the time it was our turn, the event had become huge. We knew that the methodology would work, we knew that the materials could be taught online and via self-study, thanks in part to the Gallantries work to ensure broadcast-friendliness.

So as a community we recorded **25 hours of video**, corrected the captions for it, and posted it online, free to the world.

## Logistics & Communications

The workshop was well publicised across Twitter, CINECA, ELIXIR, and the Galaxyproject websites, recruiting a large number of participants.

Our students were quite varied:

  alt="screenshot of slack channels. There's one per topic (e.g. 1-1_galaxy_intro), an some other assorted channels: instructors (private), coordinators (private), and a number of social channels.">
  <figcaption>We setup Slack channels for each topic, some private channels for instructors, and a number of social channels for participants to engage in activities.</figcaption>
</figure>

We additionally created <abbr title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</abbr> documents per channel, something we've used heavily in the past. Before the event, instructors pre-poulated the FAQ with common questions they expected. During the event, students would ask questions in Slack; if the instructors found them to be common issues they would document them in the FAQ for other students. This improved the cross-timezone impact of our event and decreased instructor burden. By documenting questions for students in other timezones, they could still benefit from an easy source of answers even in the absence of the instructor or their temporary unavailability.

We are currently working to improve the GTN framework for frequently asked questions in order to re-integrate all of these superb tutorial FAQ documents back into the training material where they'll be visible and accessible to students of other events.

## Videos

The main, massive change with this event was the asynchronous nature. We created videos for as many topics as we could in advance and then placed all of these on YouTube for our students. Subtitles were a hard requirement for the videos, given the world-wide nature and number of non-native English speakers that would attend this event, both as instructors and students. Many of our instructors, for instance, have strong accents and we needed to ensure the videos were completely accessible to our students. This is something we *cannot* achieve in real life that we can do *better* in an asynchronous event.

Subtitles | Plays         | Watch time (hours)
--------- | -----         | ------------------
off       | 4,178 (58.2%) | 837.2 (54.0%)
English   | 2,999 (41.8%) | 710.5 (45.9%)
{: .table.table-striped}

By watch time **45% of our users watched with subtitles**.

## Slack

We did daily icebreakers during the event:

1. Introduce yourself, tell us where you're joining from, and one thing about your surroundings (e.g. it's snowing outside, there's a squirrel on my porch, my cat is on my keyboard)
2. Share with us how your 5-year-old self would have finished this sentence: 'When I grow up, I want to be ...' (and what you are actually doing now that you're grown up)
3. Share with us your favorite dish (food or drink) bonus points for recipes! ;)
4. Please let us know what you favorite thing about the course is so far.
5. Share one of your favorite books, tv shows, movies or games that you would recommend to others.

These were absolutely fantastic for student engagement during the event. It let them share something and others comment on it, fostering discussion in what could otherwise a very isolating experience working along in your home or office.

## Helpers

The logistics of organising helpers across such a wide arrange of timezones was not a simple task! We started by breaking the world into three regions, <abbr title="asia / pacific">APAC</abbr> (or <abbr title="Asia / Pacific / Oceania">APO</abbr> in our documents), <abbr title="Europe, Middle East, Africa">EMEA</abbr>, and the Americas. We recruited helpers from each of these regions.

![Heatmap of the world with helpers spread across. Most helpers resided in the US, followed by Europe. India, South Africa, and Brazil are also represented](/assets/images/smorg-helpers.png)

## Participants

We asked students to register in TIaaS, the Training Infastructure as a Service system that is available on UseGalaxy.eu and UseGalaxy.org.au which allowed us to track a subset of them during the week.

## Feedback

The feedback from students was largely very positive. Most students found the training extremely useful to them.

![bar chart titled "How useful was the training". 79 responses. 79,7% gave a 5; 17,7% gave a 4.](/assets/images/smorg-f-useful.png)

Importantly for us, most students compared this event favourably with a face-to-face training, reporting "I am very happy with my virtual experience".

![bar chart titled: how would you compare this with a face-to-face event. Was it ok? was it enough? 79 responses. 59,5% gave a 5; 32,9% gave a 4](/assets/images/smorg-f2f.png)

And likewise, many people were very, very happy with the videos as a format.

![bar chart titled: where the videos a useful format? 79 responses. 64,6% report a 5; 30,4% give it a 4.](/assets/images/smorg-videos-useful.png)

We asked students about the best and worst aspects of the event. They identified a number of things they really liked

"Best" Aspect                | People reporting this
-------------                | ---------------------
[Specific Topic]             | 27
Async / Flexibility for them | 20
Tutorials                    | 17
Videos                       | 12
Instructors                  | 10
Community & Icebreakers      | 9
Organisation                 | 8
{: .table.table-striped}

Students provided additional feedback which we really appreciated. Flexibility ranked very highly for participants:

> I could focus on the parts that I found the most interesting, flexible schedule.

We worried about the 'cost' of the video production in terms of course preparation time but it was highlight again and again as an important feature:

> The entire workshop was run very smoothly. The tutorial videos were clear and easy to understand. I enjoyed going through tutorials with the videos, rather than just clicking through the steps of a Galaxy tutorial on my own, where it tends to feel like I am just going through the motions. The added explanation of the instructors gave me additional clarity and understanding of the tools I was using.

> Content! & detailed videos helped us to feel comfortable with tutorials and software, believe me, without videos just with tutorials we could be slightly less motivated to complete

One of the lowest rated aspects of our previous course was the lack of socialisation, but here we received only positive comments. Everyone understands the issues of the pandemic and the interactions in the icebreakers were useful for helping people get to know each other depsite the separation:

> The best parts, in my opinion, were the quality of the trainings and precise information/instructions, as well as the fruitful interaction between trainers and attendees on Slack. I also enjoyed the daily icebreakers, it was really nice to feel like part of the community.

Likewise we asked about the worst aspects of the event for them:

"Worst" Aspect                                  | People reporting this
----                                            | ----
Too much content for 1 week                     | 11
Specific tutorial                               | 4
Too much/little detail in video                 | 4
Waiting for Galaxy                              | 2
Tool issues                                     | 2
Lack of videos in CYOA                          | 2
Needing to use different servers                | 1
Lack of publicisation of course                 | 1
Size of videos for those with limited bandwidth | 1
Lack of in-person social aspect                 | 1
{: .table.table-striped}

Many people reported similar experiences regarding the volume of the content. It is an unfortunate reality that bosses and colleagues often see online events differently to in-person training:

> The time to do all the tutorial. For people who are working is difficult to organize work with the course.

> I thought I would be faster, there were more tutorials i wanted to try

That said, we did not expect people to attempt to complete everything, especially due to the diversity of content we covered. We have changed our wording in upcoming events to call them "modules" rather than "days" to help re-inforce that students should pick the topics which are interesting to them.

## Accessibility

There are a few responses from attendees we especially want to highlight. Captioning all of the video material was an extremely important point for us for accessibility.
8 people specificcally requsted captions for the videos in the accomodations section of the registration form, and we were so happy to be able to accomodate them.

> It's awesome that you added subtitles to everything. Way to go to remove barriers!
> [..]
> Hats off to you! I really profit from the subtitles, can even follow videos without sound that way.

This enabled not only d/Deaf/<abbr title="hard of hearing">HoH</abbr> participants to attend, but also those who might have struggled with the accents of our instructors, or the rate at which they spoke. Another 8 registrants specifically requested recordings (something they might have missed in the course advertising) but yet another fantastic benefit of asynchronous events like ours is that all materials remain online and participants can follow them at their own pace, reviewing them as needed.
