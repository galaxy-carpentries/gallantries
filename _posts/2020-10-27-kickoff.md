title: Gallantries Project Kickoff Meeting
---

We had our project Kickoff meeting today, and given our [comittment]({% link about.md %}#values) to transparency and open science, we have committed to doing all of our project management in the open, on GitHub.

## Roadmap

You can check out our [project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/gallantries/projects/1) on GitHub where we will be doing all of our organisation and issue tracking.

## Minutes

Likewise, our [meeting minutes](https://github.com/gallantries/organisation/issues/1) have been posted on our issue board. We believe by being open and transparent from the beginning we can improve stakeholder and community engagement in the process by giving everyone a voice within our project.
