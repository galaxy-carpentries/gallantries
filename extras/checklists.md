# Checklist for Organizing Gallantries Training Events

*This checklist has been adapted and extended from [Galaxy](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/instructors/tutorials/organize-workshop/tutorial.html) and [The Carpentries](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/hosts_instructors/hosts_instructors_checklist.html) workshop checklists (see the references)*

## Hosts/Organisers

  * Contact information for instructors in case of last minute changes
* Print materials
  * Teaching and helpers notes
  * Handouts
  * Sign-in sheets

  * Name badges for attendees (and helpers) are important for participants as well. At busy venues, it can help attendees to find each other and remember each others’ names.
  * Have space for people to specify pronouns
  * For the helpers, usually with a different color border so attendees can identify people who can help them with any issues they encounter.
* If the local computers are used, make sure the required software is installed.
* Identify/request instructors and helpers
* Send a request form with following details
  * Hosting organizations
  * Sites and Local contacts

  * Suggest Instructors or ask for help in recruting.
  * Name the helpers
* Arrange a sound system in the classroom
  * Remind instructors to arrange microphone/headphones
* Make sure wifi or wired internet connection in the classroom and in the instructor's room is of sufficient speed.
* Setup registration (Eventbrite/google form)
  * The registration form should ask whether instructors, helpers, or learners need any advance arrangements to ensure they can participate in the event. This may include considering whether or not
* Prepare for visiting instructors
  * Make travel arrangements for them or communicate the reimbursement process
  * Make accommodation arrangements for them or maybe point out some good choices using your local knowledge
  * If you will give instructors a thank-you gift, find something that is inclusive regardless of their background (so wine/chocolate/food are bad choices). Hand written thank you card is a good choice.
* Arrange required materials and equipment
  * Sett up extension cords or power strips
  * Sticky notes in two contrasting colors (see recommendations for more information how to select the colors)
  * Name tags to help people get to know each other
  * Extra pens and paper in case people want to take notes by hand
  * Pens for blackboard, whiteboard or flipboard
* Arrange for beverages, snacks, and meals. Remember about dietary requirements.
  * Catering can be expensive. If you choose to have participants find their own lunch, then you should add nearby lunch location ideas to the workshop webpage.
  * If your workshop is a multi-day workshop, you should include dinner options on the workshop webpage.
  * Ensure that your catering service will label the food for contents/allergens (e.g. for vegetarian/vegan/allergens like gluten, etc.)

* Contact instructors to set up a workshop webpage together.
* Make a reservation for a social dinner, if any.
* Prepare the participation certificates.
* Confirm criteria for reimbursement for visitors if applicable (Per diem or save receipts. Are digital ticets acceptable?).
* Identify places you can promote your event. [Galaxy Hub](https://github.com/galaxyproject/galaxy-hub) or [Carpentries Discuss List](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discuss) are the primary places to do this. You should do this 3-6 month in advance of your event (if you can).
