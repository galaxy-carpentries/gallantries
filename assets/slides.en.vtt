00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:12.423
What is Galaxy?

9
00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:16.775
Galaxy is a web based data analysis platform.

10
00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:19.704
It is easy to use, and completely free.

11
00:00:19.704 --> 00:00:22.944
Galaxy offers over eight thousand analysis tools.

12
00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:28.224
Galaxy is widely used. It currently has over ten thousand publications.

14
00:00:29.264 --> 00:00:31.904
Data analysis can be very complex.

15
00:00:31.904 --> 00:00:36.536
It often requires specialized programming knowledge or command line skills.

16
00:00:36.536 --> 00:00:42.896
Galaxy makes this a lot easier by providing a graphical user interface to popular data analysis tools.

17
00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:49.975
Galaxy is web based. This means you don't have to install anything, just open your browser and go to Galaxy.

18
00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:53.119
Galaxy supports many different scientific domains.

20
00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.791
How do I use Galaxy?

22
00:00:56.831 --> 00:01:03.383
There are three main Galaxy servers. Galaxy Main, Galaxy Europe, and Galaxy Australia.

23
00:01:03.383 --> 00:01:08.975
These three Galaxies have the biggest teams behind them, and offer the most tools and resources.

24
00:01:08.975 --> 00:01:12.456
You can register an account for free on any of these servers.

25
00:01:12.456 --> 00:01:16.512
In addition, there are many smaller galaxy servers to choose from.

26
00:01:16.512 --> 00:01:24.599
Many of these are domain specific. For example, Galaxy proteomics focuses on proteomics tools and workflows.

28
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.384
The Galaxy user interface consists of three main parts.

29
00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:32.168
On the left is the list of available tools.

30
00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:37.112
In the middle panel you will run your analysis tools and view your data and results.

31
00:01:37.112 --> 00:01:40.304
On the right is a full record of your analysis history.

33
00:01:41.344 --> 00:01:45.520
The first step of an analysis is to get your data into Galaxy.

34
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.824
This can be done in several ways.

35
00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:50.248
You can upload files from your computer.

36
00:01:50.248 --> 00:01:54.544
Or you can enter a URL, and Galaxy will download the data for you.

37
00:01:54.544 --> 00:02:03.160
Furthermore, Galaxy can import data directly from many online data stores such as UCSC, NCBI, and many more.

39
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.128
All files you upload will appear in your history.

40
00:02:07.128 --> 00:02:10.272
There are 3 button on each dataset in your history.

41
00:02:10.272 --> 00:02:16.296
The eye icon lets you view the dataset. This will show up in the middle panel of Galaxy.

42
00:02:16.296 --> 00:02:23.424
The pencil icon allows you to edit the attributes of the file. For example you can change the file name here.

43
00:02:23.424 --> 00:02:27.048
The cross icon lets you delete the dataset from your history.

44
00:02:27.048 --> 00:02:33.384
You can also click on the dataset to expand it. This will show more information and more options.

46
00:02:34.424 --> 00:02:38.072
After your data is uploaded, you are ready to run tools.

47
00:02:38.072 --> 00:02:41.840
You can find tools by exploring the tool list on the left.

48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.416
If you already know the name of the tool you want to use, you can enter this in the search box at the top of the tool panel.

49
00:02:48.416 --> 00:02:54.152
If you have found a tool you like, you can add it to your favorites by clicking the star at the top of the tool.

51
00:02:55.192 --> 00:02:58.743
When you click on a tool, it will show up in the middle panel.

52
00:02:58.743 --> 00:03:02.919
Here you can select your input files and set the parameters for the tool.

53
00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.015
Then you can hit the execute button to start the tool.

55
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:10.199
The results of the analysis will be added to your history.

56
00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.775
You will see these output files go through various states.

57
00:03:13.775 --> 00:03:17.519
When a dataset is grey, it means it is waiting to run.

58
00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.903
When it turns orange, it means the tool is running.

59
00:03:20.903 --> 00:03:25.823
When the tool is finished, the outputs will turn green if the tool ran successfully.

60
00:03:25.823 --> 00:03:29.855
You can then click on the history item to get more information and options.

61
00:03:29.855 --> 00:03:33.335
For example, you can download the file to your computer.

62
00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:36.431
Or you can reload the tool with the same parameters.

63
00:03:36.431 --> 00:03:39.335
There is also an option to visualize your data.

64
00:03:39.335 --> 00:03:42.407
If there was a problem with the tool, it will turn red.

65
00:03:42.407 --> 00:03:48.815
You can click on the bug icon to view the error message or submit a error report to the Galaxy administrators.

67
00:03:49.855 --> 00:03:53.623
Galaxy also has many options to visualize your datasets.

68
00:03:53.623 --> 00:03:57.967
Depending on the data type, there will be different visualisation options.

70
00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:05.823
When you want to start a new analysis, you can create a new history using the plus icon at the top of the history panel.

71
00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:08.415
You can have as many histories as you want.

72
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.679
You can easily switch back and forth between histories.

73
00:04:11.679 --> 00:04:15.735
Giving your histories good names will help you keep track of your analyses'.

75
00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:20.039
Workflows let you run your analyses very easily.

76
00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.703
There are multiple ways to create a workflow.

77
00:04:22.703 --> 00:04:26.207
Workflows can be automatically extracted from a history.

78
00:04:26.207 --> 00:04:32.519
This means you perform the analysis manually once, and then can easily repeat it on different input data.

79
00:04:32.519 --> 00:04:36.503
You can also build workflows by hand using the workflow editor.

80
00:04:36.503 --> 00:04:39.983
Or you can import a workflow somebody else has shared with you.

82
00:04:41.024 --> 00:04:43.543
Everything you do in Galaxy can be shared.

83
00:04:43.543 --> 00:04:47.719
You can share your history, your workflow, and your visualizations.

84
00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:50.095
There are different ways to share your work.

85
00:04:50.095 --> 00:04:53.191
You can either share it with specific Galaxy users.

86
00:04:53.191 --> 00:04:56.527
Or you can get a share link that you can send to anybody.

87
00:04:56.527 --> 00:04:59.959
If you publish your work, it will be visible to everybody.

89
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.567
