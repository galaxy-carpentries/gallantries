## [Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands](https://erasmusmc.nl)

EMC is one of the two founding members of the Galaxy Training Materials and regularly hosts training events and courses for PhD level students. The EMC is an ELIXIR-NL partner and provides extensive input to the ELIXIR-NL training platform, having contributed to many ELIXIR workshops. They are also currently involved as a leading partner in an ELIXIR Community-led Galaxy implementation study (IS). The EMC has extensive experience in transnational projects. The researchers that will participate in this Gallantries project are also active partners in the European CINECA project (Common Infrastructure for National Cohorts in Europe, Canada, and Africa) and ELIXIR.


## [Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany](https://uni-freiburg.de/)

ALU-FR is the other founding member of the Galaxy Training Materials and regularly provides introductory bioinformatics and coding courses to MSc and PhD level students. ALU-FR also runs the European Galaxy server, the second-largest Galaxy server in the world, supporting scientific research across Europe, with over 15,000 registered users and over 2,500 available tools and workflows. ALU-FR is another lead partner on the ELIXIR Galaxy IS.

## [INAB|CERTH, Thessaloniki, Greece](www2.inab.certh.gr/?page_id=32&lang=en)

INAB-CERTH is the flagship Institute for Biomolecular research in Northern Greece. Its mission is to carry out fundamental and applied research with emphasis on development of novel products and services of scientific, industrial, economic and social importance in the fields of Bioinformatics, Molecular Medicine and Pharmacogenetics. As part of their mission, INAB-CERTH provides systematic training at different academic levels; MSc, PhD students as well as a number of internships in collaboration with all major Universities in Greece. Additionally, they are leading two tasks of the ELIXIR Training Platform and they are a member of the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) Skills and Training working group.

## [Institut national de recherche pour l’agriculture, l’alimentation et l’environnement, Rennes, Franche](https://www.inrae.fr/en)
INRAE is the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and Environment, employing more than 10,000 people in 18 regional centers. They have contributed in-depth tutorials on individual components to the GTN and organise regular local and international training sessions for different target groups: MS, PhD students, but also researchers in bioinformatics or biology. Together with the GenOuest bioinformatics platform, they are active members of IFB, the french ELIXIR node, contributing to national and european working groups and infrastructures based on Cloud Computing and Galaxy.

## [Muséum national d’histoire naturelle](https://www.mnhn.fr/en)

MNHN is one of the world’s major natural history institutions and contributes to the knowledge and conservation of biodiversity through research, higher education (Master and PhD studies), and conservation of reference collections, as well as providing expertise to the French and European government for environmental policies. Involvement of PNDB in several national training programmes and research projects, and internationally involved in several H2020 projects (EOSC-Pillar) and calls for proposal (BRIDGES and OpenMinds proposals) and initiatives like GO FAIR (coordinating BiodiFAIRse Implementation Network) provide ideal additional dissemination platforms for the outputs from this project.
